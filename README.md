## Project Description
Our goal for this project is to create a **working robotic arm** which, when complete, will be able to use **stepper motors** and servos to succesfully move a writing utensil around on paper to write things down.

## Proof of Concept
For our proof of concept, we decided to create something that might emulate what the final product would look like. To do this, we first looked at a few examples of 3D printers around the engineering lab to see what cartesian arms were made of. 
After this, we thought why not just mimic how 3d printers work, but use it for our own purposes? Eventually we found out about Openbuilds, more on that later. We used openbuilds to recreate a single axis of movement using wheel bearings, a stepper motor and a carbon fiber belt drive chain. After wiring everything together, our completed proof of concept was able to move a plate on an axis using a stepper motor. Photos attached below.
